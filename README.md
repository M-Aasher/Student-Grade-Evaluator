# 🎓 Grade-Calculator

This program determines a student’s grade based on the marks entered (out of 100).
It uses if–else if–else conditional statements to assign the correct grade category and prints a personalized message for each range.

## 🎯 Purpose

To practice conditional branching in C using if–else if–else statements,
and to apply real-world logic for grading based on numerical input.

## 🧠 Logic

### Input: Student’s marks (0–100)  

### Validation: Ensure marks are within range  

### Grade Assignment:

Range 	 Grade  	Message  
90–100  	A+ 	    Brilliant work!  
80–89	    A	      Nice job.
70–79 	  B	      Keep up the good work.   
60–69	    C	      Try your best next time.   
50–59	    D	      You must take studies seriously!    
Below 50	F	      You have failed. Bring your parents tomorrow to the Headmaster’s office!    

## 🧩 Example Input/Output   
1. Enter your marks out of 100: 92  
   Your grade is A+ — Brilliant work!  

2. Enter your marks out of 100: 47  
   Your grade is F — You have failed. Bring your parents tomorrow to the Headmaster's office, UNDERSTOOD!!!   

3. Enter your marks out of 100: 105  
   INVALID INPUT! Marks must be between 0 and 100.
